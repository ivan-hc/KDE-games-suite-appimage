## History

*Previously it was based on Debian Stable, but due to GLIBC compatibility it was replaced by JuNest in 2023, July 25th*

Compiling these so-called "ArchImages" is easier and the Arch Linux base is a guarantee of continuity being one of the most important GNU/Linux distributions, supported by a large community that offers more guarantees of continuity, while usually unofficial PPAs are mantained by one or two people and built as a third-party repository for Ubuntu, a distro that is more inclined to push Snaps as official packaging format instead of DEBs.

Learn more about ArchImage packaging at https://github.com/ivan-hc/ArchImage

*NOTE: the 32-bit version for the old i386 architectures is available at [ivan-hc/32-bit-AppImage-packages-database](https://github.com/ivan-hc/32-bit-AppImage-packages-database) and is based on Debian Stable, download it from [here](https://github.com/ivan-hc/32-bit-AppImage-packages-database/releases/tag/kdegames).*

## Install and update them with ease

I wrote two bash scripts to install and manage the applications: [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager) and [AppMan](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan). Their dual existence is based on the needs of the end user.

| [**"AM" Application Manager**](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager) |
| -- |
| <sub>***If you want to install system-wide applications on your GNU/Linux distribution in a way that is compatible with [Linux Standard Base](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/lsb.shtml) (all third-party apps must be installed in dedicated directories under `/opt` and their launchers and binaries in `/usr/local/*` ...), just use ["AM" Application Manager](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager). This app manager requires root privileges only to install / remove applications, the main advantage of this type of installation is that the same applications will be available to all users of the system.***</sub>

| [**"AppMan"**](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan)
| --
| <sub>***If you don't want to put your app manager in a specific path but want to use it portable and want to install / update / manage all your apps locally, download ["AppMan"](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan) instead. With this script you will be able to decide where to install your applications (at the expense of a greater consumption of resources if the system is used by more users). AppMan is portable, all you have to do is write the name of a folder in your `$HOME` where you can install all the applications available in [the "AM" database](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager/tree/main/programs), and without root privileges.***</sub>

### Reduce the size of the JuNest based Appimage
You can analyze the presence of excess files inside the AppImage by extracting it:

    ./*.AppImage --appimage-extract
To start your tests, run the "AppRun" script inside the "squashfs-root" folder extracted from the AppImage:

    ./squashfs-root/AppRun
