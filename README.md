From here you can download the scripts to build from Debian Stable and on top of [JuNest](https://github.com/fsquillace/junest), the lightweight Arch Linux based distro that runs, without root privileges, on top of any other Linux distro.

If you are an Nvidia user, for the JuNest-based build, hardware accelleration is provided by [Conty](https://github.com/Kron4ek/Conty). At first start it will install Nvidia drivers locally to allow the builtin Arch Linux container the use of hardware accelleration.

*"AM"/"AppMan" is a set of scripts and modules for installing, updating, and managing AppImage packages and other portable formats, in the same way that APT manages DEBs packages, DNF the RPMs, and so on... using a large database of Shell scripts inspired by the Arch User Repository, each dedicated to an app or set of applications.*

*The engine of "AM"/"AppMan" is the "APP-MANAGER" script which, depending on how you install or rename it, allows you to install apps system-wide (for a single system administrator) or locally (for each user).*

*"AM"/"AppMan" aims to be the default package manager for all AppImage packages, giving them a home to stay.*

*You can consult the entire **list of managed apps** at [**portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps**](https://portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps).*
